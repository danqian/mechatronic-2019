# Breathing structure testing

## 1. Key structures
 
 * Basement to support motors: vacuum forming

 * Motor positions in support

 * Structure guiding the fabric to move, attached to motor cap

## 2. Working Videos
Workable test sample: Breathing pad

Here are two videos show how it work with breath sensor.

 * T-shirt outside

Here are two videos show how it works.

## 4. Faliures
 
 * I was trying to use only on motor to make fabric move. It failed due to the limited space for up-down contraptions.

 * The thickness of material leads to large size pad, so it is hard to attached on cloth comfortably
