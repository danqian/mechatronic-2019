# Breathing structure testing

## 1. Key structures
 
 * Basement to support motors: vacuum forming

 * Motor positions in support

 * Structure guiding the fabric to move, attached to motor cap

## 2. Working Videos
Workable test sample: Breathing pad

#### Here are two videos show how it work with breath sensor.

 * [breathing pad with human breathing control](https://github.com/danqian/mechatronic-2019/blob/master/Final%20Project/media/motor%20control%20structure/breathing%20pad%20with%20human%20breathing%20control.mp4)

 ## 3. Faliures
 
 * I was trying to use only on motor to make fabric move. It failed due to the limited space for up-down contraptions.

 * The thickness of material leads to large size pad, so it is hard to attached on cloth comfortably
