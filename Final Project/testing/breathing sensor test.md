# Breathing Sensors

#### I tested two kind of breathing sensor to see which one works better. The result shows that the rubber band one win.

### 1.weaved breathing sensor

* Video shows how it works:[breath sensor-WEAVE video testing](https://github.com/danqian/mechatronic-2019/blob/master/Final%20Project/media/weaved%20yarn%20sensor/weaved%20sensor%20testing.mp4)

* The result shows that it not works well on human body because it does not detect small variables sensitively.

### 2. Rubber band breathing sensor
#### This sensor is using stetch sensor to detect the chest movement of breathing.

### 3. Coding
This sensor works much better than the weaved one. Thus I am trying to mapping the reading numbers on Servos degrees.
