# musle wire testing



### -Figure out the parameter
 1. Force: not begin yet, need a spring balance

 2. Test to figure out the input current of muscle wire: 
    I activate the wire with a transformer, when the voltage goes to 4.5v it begin to slowly move, and I tried to directly set voltage to   6v, it moves much faster.

### -Test on T-shirt
1. Sew the wire on the clothes
2. Hang the weight to bend the wire
3. activate the wire with current
