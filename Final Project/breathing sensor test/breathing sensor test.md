# breathing sensors

## I tested two kind of breathing sensor to see which one works better. The result shows that the rubber band one win.

### 1.weaved breathing sensor

#### Video shows how it works:

The result shows that it not works well on human body because it does not detect small variables sensitively.

### 2. Rubber band breathing sensor
#### This sensor is using stetch sensor to detect the chest movement of breathing.

### 3. Coding
This sensor works much better than the weaved one. Thus I am trying to mapping the reading numbers on Servos degrees.
