# Goals of project briefly
My project is to make a T-shirt that reflect people's breathing state.

Choice of hardware and software achieves that goal
* I chose rubber stretch as the main part of Breath detector, because it is sensitive and accurate. This amazing cord will act as a variable resistor, and will change in resistance as it is stretched or released. * 
* The arduino board to drive the motorwould is the Nano which is small enough for wearable devices
